## 🚀 About Me

Veteran technologist with roots dating back to the dial-up era, now pioneering the frontier of **Small Language Models (SLMs)** and **AI-powered automation**. I specialize in building autonomous agent systems that solve real-world business problems with practical, efficient AI solutions.

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Jay"
        self.expertise = ["AI/ML", "SLMs", "Multi-Agent Systems", "FinTech"]
        self.passion = "Pushing the boundaries of machine learning"
        self.approach = "Practical AI that delivers real value"
```

## 🔬 Current Focus

- **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: Developing efficient, specialized AI agents
- **Autonomous Systems**: Building multi-agent frameworks for complex workflows
- **FinTech Innovation**: AI-powered financial compliance and automation
- **Code Modernization**: Automated refactoring and technical debt elimination

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### 🔍 [AuditMap](https://github.com/jayjz/AuditMap)
An autonomous FinTech agent that revolutionizes corporate expense auditing through the combination of SLMs and OCR technology. Automatically validates expenses against company policies, eliminating manual review bottlenecks.

**Tech Stack:** Python | SLM | OCR | FinTech

### 💼 [VeritasExpense](https://github.com/jayjz/VeritasExpense)
Advanced AI framework for detecting anomalies and non-compliant transactions in corporate expense reports. Leverages LLMs to identify patterns and policy violations that traditional rule-based systems miss.

**Tech Stack:** Python | LLM | Anomaly Detection | Compliance

### ⚙️ [CodeForgeSLM](https://github.com/jayjz/CodeForgeSLM)
Autonomous multi-agent system powered by SLMs for automated code modernization, refactoring, testing, and technical debt elimination. Transforms legacy codebases into modern, maintainable systems.

**Tech Stack:** Python | Multi-Agent Systems | SLM | Code Analysis
